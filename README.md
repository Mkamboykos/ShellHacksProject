Manuel Kamboykos: 
"I worked on the both the front and back end of the website (www.technosentinel.ml), which hosted a live online broadcast of the Raspberry Pi 4 camera view through an online mjpg-streamer. It was my first time establishing a domain and connecting it to a cloud computing service like Microsoft Azure. It was also a great opportunity to utilize my knowledge of web development to create an entire website from scratch."
